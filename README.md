# Remote scanning with Chef InSpec

Chef InSpec has an amazing capability to remote scan many of your environments to CIS and STIG standards.

Here at Chef we have created `Apprentice Chef` an environment in the Cloud that will allow you to spend some time trying out the Chef InSpec capabilities. <br />
If you would like to try out Chef InSpec then please drop me an email at [inspec-remote-scanning@chef.io](mailto:inspec-remote-scanning@chef.io) and I can set an environment up. <br />
To run the labs you will require:
1. Internet connectivity,
2. [Microsoft Remote Desktop](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-clients) to access the Windows Workstation.
3. Some spare time, about 30 minutes to an hour per lab.

The following scanning labs are available:

1. [Scan AWS Cloud](labs/aws_cloud.md)
2. [Scan Azure Cloud](labs/azure_cloud.md)
3. [Scan GCP Cloud](labs/gcp_cloud.md)
4. TBD - [Scan a Docker container](labs/docker_container.md)
5. TBD - [Scan a Linux Node](labs/linux_node.md)
